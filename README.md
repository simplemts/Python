All folders/files here are related to various Python projects.  
I alternate between 2.7.x and 3.x depending on the project and dependent modules.
My primary focus is to use 3.x whenever possible, but there are severe limitations with that.

Almost all of my projects are data related, focusing on :
 1. Data Munging: 	Cleaning, preparing, aggregating, removing, imputing, etc.
 2. Web Scraping: 	Data retrieval from web site HTML/XML/JSON/etc.
 3. Analysis: 		Where the real fun is !
